		<code id="src6" class="dotCoverSource"><pre>Feature: HBase Stargate Client
	In order to read and write HBase data
	As an application developer
	I want access to all available REST operations on HBase Stargate via a managed client API

Background:
	Given I have everything I need to test a disconnected HBase client, with the following options:
		| server URL              | content type | false row key |
		| http://test-server:9999 | text/xml     | row           |
	And I have everything I need to test a content converter for XML
	And I have an HBase client

#Scenario: Create a table
#	Given I have created a new table definition
#	And I have set my table definition&#39;s name to &quot;test&quot;
#	And I have added a column named &quot;alpha&quot; to my table definition
#	When I create a table using my table definition
#	Then a REST request should have been submitted with the following values:
#		| method | url                                 | table | column |
#		| POST   | http://test-server:9999/test/schema | test  | alpha  |

Scenario Outline: Write a single value
	Given I have an identifier consisting of a &lt;table&gt;, a &lt;row&gt;, a &lt;column&gt;, a &lt;qualifier&gt;, and a &lt;timestamp&gt;
	When I write the value &quot;hello world&quot; using my identifier
	Then a REST request should have been submitted with the correct &lt;method&gt; and &lt;resource&gt;
	And the REST request should have contained 1 cell
	And one of the cells in the REST request should have had the value &quot;hello world&quot;
Examples:
	| table | row | column | qualifier | timestamp | method | resource         |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  |           |           | POST   | test/1/alpha     |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  | x         |           | POST   | test/1/alpha:x   |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  |           | 4         | POST   | test/1/alpha/4   |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  | x         | 4         | POST   | test/1/alpha:x/4 |

Scenario: Write multiple values
	Given I have created a set of cells for the &quot;test&quot; table
	And I have added a cell to my set with the following properties:
		| row | column | qualifier | value       |
		| 1   | beta   | x         | hello world |
	And I have added a cell to my set with the following properties:
		| row | column | qualifier | value       |
		| 1   | beta   | y         | dlrow olleh |
	And I have added a cell to my set with the following properties:
		| row | column | qualifier | value       |
		| 1   | beta   | z         | lorum ipsum |
	When I write the set of cells
	Then a REST request should have been submitted with the following values:
		| method | resource |
		| POST   | test/row |
	And the REST request should have contained 3 cells
	And one of the cells in the REST request should have had the following values:
		| row | column | qualifier | value       |
		| 1   | beta   | x         | hello world |
	And one of the cells in the REST request should have had the following values:
		| row | column | qualifier | value       |
		| 1   | beta   | y         | dlrow olleh |
	And one of the cells in the REST request should have had the following values:
		| row | column | qualifier | value       |
		| 1   | beta   | z         | lorum ipsum |

Scenario Outline: Read a row
	Given I have a cell query consisting of a &lt;table&gt;, a &lt;row&gt;, a &lt;column&gt;, a &lt;qualifier&gt;, a &lt;begin&gt; timestamp, and a &lt;end&gt; timestamp
	When I read a row using my query
	Then a REST request should have been submitted with the correct &lt;method&gt; and &lt;resource&gt;
Examples:
	| table | row | column | qualifier | begin | end | method | resource           |
	| test  | 1   |        |           |       |     | GET    | test/1             |
	| test  | 1   |        |           |       | 5   | GET    | test/1/*/5         |
	| test  | 1   |        |           | 4     |     | GET    | test/1             |
	| test  | 1   |        |           | 4     | 5   | GET    | test/1/*/4,5       |
	| test  | 1   |        | x         |       |     | GET    | test/1             |
	| test  | 1   |        | x         |       | 5   | GET    | test/1/*/5         |
	| test  | 1   |        | x         | 4     |     | GET    | test/1             |
	| test  | 1   |        | x         | 4     | 5   | GET    | test/1/*/4,5       |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  |           |       |     | GET    | test/1/alpha       |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  |           |       | 5   | GET    | test/1/alpha/5     |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  |           | 4     |     | GET    | test/1/alpha       |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  |           | 4     | 5   | GET    | test/1/alpha/4,5   |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  | x         |       |     | GET    | test/1/alpha:x     |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  | x         |       | 5   | GET    | test/1/alpha:x/5   |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  | x         | 4     |     | GET    | test/1/alpha:x     |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  | x         | 4     | 5   | GET    | test/1/alpha:x/4,5 |
	
Scenario Outline: Read a single value
	Given I have an identifier consisting of a &lt;table&gt;, a &lt;row&gt;, a &lt;column&gt;, and a &lt;qualifier&gt;
	When I read a single value using my identifier
	Then a REST request should have been submitted with the correct &lt;method&gt; and &lt;resource&gt;
Examples:
	| table | row | column | qualifier | method | resource           |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  |           | GET    | test/1/alpha       |
	| test  | 1   | alpha  | x         | GET    | test/1/alpha:x     |

#Scenario: Create a scanner

	And I have an identifier consisting of a &lt;table&gt;, a &lt;row&gt;, a &lt;column&gt;, a &lt;qualifier&gt;, and a &lt;timestamp&gt;
	When I delete an item using my identifier
	Then a REST request should have been submitted with the correct &lt;method&gt; and &lt;resource&gt;
